								<h3>Yashika Bajaj</h3>
								<p>Life has been a little travel diary since childhood due to my dadâ€™s transferable job but it is kind of fun to keep shifting and getting to know more people. I am originally from North India, born in Roorkee. I have done my high school from Steel city Bhilai and my undergrad from Temple City Bhubaneshwar. The last stop in my little journey named life before I left India was Mumbai where I was doing my job. I love travelling and the journey is still on. Hope to get the most out of it.

								<p> I am originally from North India. I was born in Roorkee, a small city in Uttarakhand, India; life has been a little travel diary since then. My father is in NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation Pvt. Ltd.) which is a transferable job therefore I have been changing schools and travelling since then. And the journey continued as I moved to Temple city Bhubaneshwar(India) where I did my undergrad from. I then moved to one of the busiest and the most populous metropolitan city of India, Mumbai for my job. Changing places and schools at such a frequent rate has made me learn more and more about new places and has inculcated in me the passion to travel the world. 
I have always lived in NTPC Colonies till my high school and have therefore neighbours of all types and from all the parts of India with different culture, traditions and customs. In this way I have learnt a lot about the diversity, different food habits, religions etc. All these have helped me grow personally.
